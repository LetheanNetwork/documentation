# Lethean Network

The Lethean network is a self-regulating infrastructure focused on **confidentiality** and **data sovereignty**. Users retain full control over their data, privacy, and digital identity, while the network enforces security and trust through decentralized protocols.

## Core Principles

- **Sovereignty**: Your data remains under your control
- **Confidentiality**: Transactions and communications are cryptographically protected
- **Resilience**: No central point of failure or control
- **Ethics**: Protocol-level enforcement of the [Axioms of Life](../web3/labs/gateway.md)
